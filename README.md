# 🧠 AI Prompt Library

A curated collection of prompts used with various AI tools and frameworks including Open WebUI for productivity, automation, and domain-specific tasks. We're going to utilize LLMs to improve workflows and cut the crap clogging up the AI-scape.

These prompts are designed for:
- 🩺 Clinical dictation and medical charting (built for my wife, a USAF physician)
- 📦 Homelab and DevOps workflows
- ✍️ Creative writing, documentation, and business operations
- 🔧 Experimenting with custom Open WebUI "models"
